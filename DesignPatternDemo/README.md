# Design Patterns Practice (Flutter/Dart)

This repository contains a **Flutter practice app** that lists the *23 GoF (Gang of Four) design patterns* on the home screen.  
Each item navigates to a detail page with a short description and (optionally) a demo implementation.  
The goal is to learn Flutter/Dart and apply **MVVM + common design patterns** in small, focused exercises.

> **Note:** This project is for **learning and experimentation only**; it is **not intended for production use**.
